    "# Dialogue Model Fine-Tuning - MELD Dating Simulator 🤖❤️\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Fine-tune LLaMA 3.1 for dating simulator with Friends character personas using pre-formatted MELD data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Features:**\n",
    "- 📊 ~1,500 pre-formatted dialogue pairs from MELD (romantic/dating conversations)\n",
    "- 🎭 6 Friends characters with distinct personalities (Chandler, Monica, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Phoebe)\n",
    "- 💕 Romantic/dating conversations only (filtered from MELD)\n",
    "- 🎯 Emotion-conditioned responses (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, neutral, fear, disgust)\n",
    "- 📝 LLaMA 3.1 chat template with system prompts (pre-formatted in notebook 02)\n",
    "- 🔊 Speaker tokens included for persona learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does:**\n",
    "- 📚 Load pre-formatted LLaMA 3.1 instruction data (no parsing needed!)\n",
    "- 🎯 Fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B with LoRA (memory efficient)\n",
    "- 🎭 Train multi-persona dating simulator\n",
    "- 📊 Monitor training with live visualizations\n",
    "- 💾 Save and test your fine-tuned model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single GPU Optimizations:**\n",
    "- LoRA: Train <1% of parameters\n",
    "- Gradient checkpointing: Reduce memory by ~40%\n",
    "- Mixed precision (FP16): 2x faster training\n",
    "- Gradient accumulation: Simulate larger batch sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Requirements:** ~12-14GB for LLaMA-8B (your L40S has 47GB!)\n",

    "## 14. Next Steps 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test different characters:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Try all 6 Friends characters with different emotions\n",
    "   generate_response('Chandler', \"Tell me a joke\", 'joy')\n",
    "   generate_response('Monica', \"Let's cook together\", 'neutral')\n",
    "   generate_response('Ross', \"What's your favorite dinosaur?\", 'joy')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build dating simulator interface:**\n",
    "   - Create character selection menu\n",
    "   - Add scenario customization\n",
    "   - Implement conversation loop\n",
    "   - Optional: Add emotion detection for user inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate model quality:**\n",
    "   - Check if Chandler responses are witty/sarcastic\n",
    "   - Check if Monica responses are organized/competitive\n",
    "   - Check if Ross responses are intellectual/nerdy\n",
    "   - Verify emotion appropriateness (sad user → comforting response)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fine-tune further:**\n",
    "   - Train for more epochs if needed (try 5-8)\n",
    "   - Adjust LoRA rank for better quality (try r=16)\n",
    "   - Experiment with generation parameters (temperature, top_p)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deploy:**\n",
    "   - Create chatbot script with character selection\n",
    "   - Add web interface (Gradio/Streamlit)\n",
    "   - Implement memory/context tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dating Simulator Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic dating sim loop\n",
    "character = \"Chandler\"  # User picks character\n",
    "scenario = \"You're on a first date at Central Perk\"\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    user_input = input(\"You: \")\n",
    "    if user_input == \"quit\":\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Optional: detect user emotion from input\n",
    "    emotion = detect_emotion(user_input)  # or default to \"neutral\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    response = generate_response(character, user_input, emotion, scenario)\n",
    "    print(f\"{character}: {response}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses too generic?**\n",
    "- Train for more epochs\n",
    "- Increase LoRA rank (r=16 or r=32)\n",
    "- Check that instruction format is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Memory during generation?**\n",
    "- Reduce `max_new_tokens`\n",
    "- Set `temperature` lower (less sampling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characters don't match personalities?**\n",
    "- Check persona descriptions in instruction format\n",
    "- Verify training data has good character distribution\n",
    "- Try training longer (more epochs)"
