    "# MELD Dating Simulator Evaluation (Fixed) 🎭📊\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Comprehensive evaluation with FIXED generation parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook evaluates:**\n",
    "- 📈 Multiple checkpoints from training automatically\n",
    "- 🎯 Dialogue Quality (perplexity, diversity, repetition)\n",
    "- 📝 Reference-Based Metrics (BLEU, ROUGE vs ground truth)\n",
    "- 🎭 Per-Character Performance (all 6 Friends characters)\n",
    "- 💭 Per-Emotion Performance (7 emotion categories)\n",
    "- 🏆 Best Checkpoint Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements:**\n",
    "- ✅ Correct EOS token (`tokenizer.eos_token_id`)\n",
    "- ✅ Repetition penalty (1.2) + no_repeat_ngram_size (3)\n",
    "- ✅ Lower temperature (0.7 instead of 0.9)\n",
    "- ✅ Reduced max_new_tokens (50 instead of 128)\n",
    "- ✅ Token-based extraction (not regex)\n",
    "- ✅ Speaker token stripping\n",

    "This notebook evaluated your MELD dating simulator with **FIXED generation parameters**:\n",
    "- ✅ Correct EOS token\n",
    "- ✅ Repetition controls\n",
    "- ✅ Optimized temperature and token limits\n",
    "- ✅ Clean token-based extraction\n",
    "- ✅ Speaker token stripping\n",

    "### Expected Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the original evaluation, responses should now:\n",
    "- ✅ Be single-turn (no multi-conversation generation)\n",
    "- ✅ Have minimal repetition (no \"Your haircut is attractive\" × 10)\n",
    "- ✅ Contain no speaker tokens (no `<Joey>`, `<Rachel>`)\n",
    "- ✅ Stop cleanly at sentence boundaries\n",

    "1. **Review qualitative examples** (Section 11) to verify response quality\n",
    "2. **Compare metrics** with previous evaluation (if available)\n",
