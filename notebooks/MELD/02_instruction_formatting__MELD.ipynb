    "Successfully created LLaMA 3.1 instruction-formatted dataset for dating simulator training!\n",

    "**What was done:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded romantic dialogue pairs from MELD (with speaker tokens)\n",
    "2. ✅ Defined 6 Friends character personas with distinct personalities\n",
    "3. ✅ Generated dating scenario descriptions\n",
    "4. ✅ Loaded LLaMA 3.1 tokenizer\n",
    "5. ✅ Formatted with LLaMA 3.1 chat template using `apply_chat_template`\n",
    "6. ✅ Added emotion conditioning in system prompts\n",
    "7. ✅ Saved training-ready dataset with `text` column\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format (LLaMA 3.1):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements:**\n",
    "- ✅ Uses official LLaMA 3.1 chat template (no manual formatting)\n",
    "- ✅ Properly structured with system/user/assistant roles\n",
    "- ✅ Saved as `text` column for direct training compatibility\n",
    "- ✅ Speaker tokens preserved in context for persona learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train the model (notebook 03):**\n",
    "   - Notebook 03 can now directly load the pre-formatted data\n",
    "   - No parsing or formatting needed in training notebook\n",
    "   - Just tokenize the `text` column and train!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training will learn:**\n",
    "   - Character-specific personalities and speech patterns\n",
    "   - Emotion-appropriate responses\n",
    "   - Dating/romantic conversation dynamics\n",
    "   - Context-aware dialogue generation with speaker awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **At inference:**\n",
    "   - Use same `apply_chat_template` with `add_generation_prompt=True`\n",
    "   - User selects a Friends character\n",
    "   - User sets dating scenario\n",
    "   - Model generates in-character responses\n",
    "   - Responses adapt to user's emotional state"
