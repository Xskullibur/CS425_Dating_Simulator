    "# Dialogue Model Fine-Tuning - Love Is Blind (v2) 🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Fine-tune LLaMA/Mistral models for dialogue generation using LoRA with pre-made dialogue pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 2 Features:**\n",
    "- 📊 Uses pre-created dialogue pairs (all 11 episodes combined)\n",
    "- 🎭 Anonymizes character names for better generalization\n",
    "  - Names in context → `[Agent]` (person being talked to)\n",
    "  - Names in response → `[User]` (person being addressed by agent)\n",
    "- 🚀 Faster data loading (no on-the-fly pair creation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does:**\n",
    "- 📚 Load pre-processed Love Is Blind dialogue pairs (~11,960 pairs)\n",
    "- 🔄 Replace character names with generic placeholders\n",
    "- 🎯 Fine-tune LLaMA/Mistral with LoRA (memory efficient)\n",
    "- 🎭 Support both basic and emotion-conditioned modes\n",
    "- 📊 Monitor training with live visualizations\n",
    "- 💾 Save and test your fine-tuned model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single GPU Optimizations:**\n",
    "- LoRA: Train <1% of parameters\n",
    "- Gradient checkpointing: Reduce memory by ~40%\n",
    "- Mixed precision (FP16): 2x faster training\n",
    "- Gradient accumulation: Simulate larger batch sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Requirements:** ~12-14GB for LLaMA-7B\n",

    "   # In evaluation_template.ipynb\n",
    "   DIALOGUE_CHECKPOINT = \"../checkpoints/dialogue_finetuned_v2/final\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experiment with hyperparameters:**\n",
    "   - Try different LoRA ranks (4, 8, 16)\n",
    "   - Adjust learning rate (1e-4 to 5e-4)\n",
    "   - Increase training epochs\n",
    "   - Experiment with context window size\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Try emotion conditioning:**\n",
    "   - Set `EMOTION_CONDITIONED = True`\n",
    "   - Add emotion labels to your data\n",
    "   - Re-train and compare\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Production deployment:**\n",
    "   - Use `scripts/train.py` for longer training runs\n",
    "   - Monitor with TensorBoard\n",
    "   - Save checkpoints regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Memory?**\n",
    "- Reduce `batch_size` to 1\n",
    "- Increase `gradient_accumulation_steps`\n",
    "- Reduce `max_length`\n",
    "- Lower `lora_r`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training too slow?**\n",
    "- Enable `bf16` if supported\n",
    "- Reduce `eval_steps` and `save_steps`\n",
    "- Use smaller validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor quality outputs?**\n",
    "- Train for more epochs\n",
    "- Increase `lora_r`\n",
    "- Add more training data\n",
