My beret bonnet.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>So classy.<br><br>Thank you. I try to be, you know.<br><br>Even in my slumber,<br>I try to be a classy dame.<br><br>Being a black woman,<br><br>it\\'s very important that I wrap<br>and take care of my hair at night.<br><br>And sometimes the bonnet is not<br>always the sexiest accessory.<br><br>I\\'m not sure if he has experienced that<br>before, but I know he loves me for me.<br><br>Oh, man.<br><br>Last night was magical.<br><br>I can\\'t keep<br>my hands off of you.<br><br>It\\'s that physical connection.<br><br>I\\'m a gentleman, I\\'m not going to talk<br>about whether Lauren and I had sex.<br><br>Cameron and I stayed up pretty late...<br><br>just enjoying each other\\'s company,<br>you know?<br><br>Talking...<br><br>That\\'s just between her and I.<br><br>...and stuff.<br><br>So that\\'s how it\\'s going to stay.<br><br>There was some Netflixing and chilling.<br><br>A lot of deep diving.<br><br>Morning.<br><br>Good morning.<br><br>- Wake up!<br>- No!<br><br>- Wake up.<br>- I was sleeping so good.<br><br>Waking up with Jessica is...<br><br>honestly surreal.<br><br>It\\'s everything. I woke up and I just<br>looked at her and I just...<br><br>I was happy.<br><br>I\\'m shocked about how comfortable we are,<br><br>but then again, I\\'m not shocked<br>how fast it\\'s been,<br><br>because we\\'re honestly the same person.<br><br>You know, we both are ambitious,<br><br>and outgoing and energetic.<br><br>I feel like<br>I\\'ve known her forever.<br><br>A couple things that were really good<br>that happened last night:<br><br>one, you don\\'t snore and you don\\'t sweat.<br><br>Those are two of my pet peeves.<br><br>- But...<br>- Phew!<br><br>So, we could potentially be<br>in the cuddle zone.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- But I\\'m still...<br><br>getting used to, and comfortable with,<br>like, us in the flesh,<br><br>which is so weird.<br><br>Um, I feel like when you\\'re in the pods,<br>you just...<br><br>get used to...<br><br>a voice.<br><br>I mean right now we could build<br>a pillow barrier<br><br>then we could talk as if we\\'re in the pods<br>if you want.<br><br>Oh, we could do that?<br><br>Okay, that would be excellent.<br><br>I am a physical person.<br><br>I am very, very...<br><br>Like, I guess the Hispanic in me,<br>the Latin in me,<br><br>the romance comes out.<br><br>But Jessica and I decided<br>to wait to have sex,<br><br>or anything, or be physical,<br><br>um, because I think that<br><br>if I take my time with this<br><br>and really build that foundation<br>that we\\'ve already built,<br><br>like a stack on top of it,<br><br>then I feel that this relationship<br>will last for a lifetime.<br><br>- You pictured that, didn\\'t you?<br>- I did. I was like, \"Back in the pod!\"<br><br>In Mexico, we\\'re still totally<br>without outside influence.<br><br>No social media, you know,<br><br>no devices whatsoever.<br><br>And we\\'ll just get to focus on each other<br><br>and finally get to take<br>all the emotional connection<br><br>that we\\'ve created<br><br>and also add in the physical.<br><br>I know we\\'re going to have a lot of<br>challenges in the real world,<br><br>but I wouldn\\'t change anything about him.<br><br>At the end of this, I really hope<br><br>that we\\'ll be walking down the aisle,<br>exchanging vows,<br><br>and we\\'ll be married.<br><br>Let\\'s go to the beach!<br><br>Ugh. We need to order some food.<br><br>When Carlton told me<br>about his sexuality, I was shocked.<br><br>I just knew that I needed to think,<br>I needed to pray,<br><br>I needed to just sleep in my own room.<br><br>I haven\\'t fully opened up.<br><br>What...

I\\'m happy.<br><br>She puts me at ease and makes me feel<br>comfortable with how...<br><br>crazy fast everything is going.<br><br>We\\'re going to take over<br>the world.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Bonnie and Clyde style.<br><br>- Minus the shoot-up.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- We gotta always remember that part.<br>- Always.<br><br>Minus the shoot-up.<br><br>But, uh... But I...<br><br>feel more motivated than ever.<br><br>Before, I wasn\\'t...<br><br>- really that happy, to be honest.<br>- Mm-hmm.<br><br>I think it was because I felt like<br>I was missing you.<br><br>And...<br><br>now that I have you,<br><br>it motivates me to just want to<br>make sure our lives...<br><br>are taken care of.<br><br>Aww. That makes me happy.<br><br>I\\'ve had maybe about...<br><br>two solid boyfriends.<br><br>I went through a phase where<br>I didn\\'t trust men, you know,<br><br>I thought they were all dogs.<br><br>But I think that Cameron is different.<br><br>I would have never met a man like Cameron<br>without this experiment.<br><br>I don\\'t know that<br>I\\'ve ever felt happiness like this.<br><br>We really won\\'t have to take<br>a honeymoon after this.<br><br>I know, this is our honeymoon.<br><br>- Like, seriously.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Just great.<br><br>Does anything stick out in your mind<br>in regards to, like, planning the wedding?<br><br>Making sure that...<br><br>we can get all of our friends<br>and family there<br><br>that we can.<br><br>- You have to meet my dad.<br>- I\\'m excited.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>I mean, it\\'s like...<br><br>I\\'m excited too.<br><br>- Why do you say it like that?<br>- It\\'s gonna be fun.<br><br>I just know he\\'s protective, that\\'s all.<br><br>And, like, my dad has never met<br>any of my boyfriends.<br><br>Yeah, well, I\\'m not your boyfriend.<br><br>I know, but that\\'s what makes it<br>that much more intense.<br><br>Like, \"Hey, Dad, here\\'s my fiancé.\"<br><br>Is there anything you\\'re concerned about?<br><br>Um, well, you already know<br><br>that you\\'re the first white guy<br>I\\'ve dated.<br><br>- Uh-huh.<br>- He\\'s going to grill you.<br><br>That\\'s fine.<br><br>With Cameron, I fell in love<br>with who he was on the inside.<br><br>So, I didn\\'t know if he was black, white,<br>Asian, Puerto Rican, uh...<br><br>I didn\\'t know what he was.<br><br>I guess that gives me<br>comfort and everything,<br><br>the fact that I love who he is,<br><br>but I\\'m nervous as to how<br>my dad will react.<br><br>It\\'s a lot of news<br>in a short period of time.<br><br>I mean, my dad grew up in an area<br>that was quite different, so,<br><br>- for him...<br>- It is... Yeah.<br><br>I think our generation<br>is more understanding.<br><br>Of course, when we have children,<br>or if and when,<br><br>- I mean, I definitely want to.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>But I know that the world is going to<br>perceive them as black<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- And...<br><br>you know, I know that that\\'s...<br><br>It\\'s going to make their lives<br>harder in some way.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- But I think I trust you and I<br><br>to raise them in the right way.<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>It\\'s kind of crazy<br>that Cameron and I<br><br>are actually discussing having kids<br><br>\\'cause at this point we\\'ve only known<br>each other for about two weeks.<br><br>If that.<br><br>But it just feels natural.<br>It feels organic.<br><br>It feels like I\\'m talking to my partner<br>about something that\\'s very real.<br><br>Even outside of...<br><br>what color they are,<br>they\\'re just going to be great people.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>- They\\'ll have two parents who love them.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>One that\\'s white.<br><br>One is black and fine as hell.<br><br>My heart feels like<br>it\\'s split into two.<br><br>On one hand, I feel like...<br><br>I feel blindsided. I feel like...<br><br>Was this really true love? Is this real?<br><br>But then on the other hand,<br>this is somebody that I know<br><br>that I want to be with<br><br>because I have built a relationship<br><br>and a foundation with him,<br><br>that I\\'ve never had before.<br><br>I love Carlton.<br><br>I hope that it\\'s going to be okay.<br><br>It\\'s going to work itself out.<br><br>But I do know that I need to talk to him.<br><br>I need to see him.<br><br>I need to get some things off my chest.<br><br>- Hola!<br>- Hola!<br><br>Como estas?<br><br>I can only answer in French.<br>Comme ci comme ça.<br><br>- \"So so.\"<br>- Okay.<br><br>- How you feeling?<br>- I feel good.<br><br>- You look good.<br>- You, too.

It\\'s never.<br><br>Then why didn\\'t you tell me<br>in the beginning?<br><br>Because in the beginning,<br>you will pre-judge me.<br><br>You said it\\'s never been an issue<br>with girls.<br><br>Would you have really...<br>If I had told you on the first date,<br><br>would you have given me a chance?<br>You wouldn\\'t have.<br><br>I\\'d rather you would have told me<br>up in front.<br><br>I would be able to make<br>a better decision, or be able to say,<br><br>\"Okay, you know, I understand where<br>you\\'re coming from,<br><br>but you know for sure<br>you want to be with a female.<br><br>This is how I personally feel,<br>and how I slept on it.<br><br>Last night, she was rubbing my back.<br><br>She was like, \"Give me a hug.<br><br>\"Let me talk to you, I\\'m here for you.\"<br><br>And then today it\\'s, like, all of a sudden<br>you have an issue with it.<br><br>Nah.<br><br>Do you really think that I would be here<br>if I didn\\'t have real feelings?<br><br>Like, just...

Are you guys all enjoying<br>your romantic getaway?<br><br>- Yes!<br>- Amazing!<br><br>Ladies, I know you recognize<br>the other ladies here.<br><br>And gentlemen, I know you recognize<br>the other gentlemen here.<br><br>Gentlemen, we want you to meet the ladies.<br><br>And, ladies, we want you to meet<br>the gentlemen that you did not propose to.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Kenny and Kelly.<br><br>Gigi and Damian.<br><br>Jessica and Mark.<br><br>Cameron and Lauren.<br><br>And Amber and Barnett.<br><br>Congratulations to all of you<br>on your engagements!<br><br>Oh my God,<br>I didn\\'t expect to see Barnett.<br><br>He physically looks exactly<br>like what I had thought.<br><br>When I had fallen for Barnett, I would<br>think about him around-the-clock.<br><br>The moment he told me<br>he had changed his mind.<br><br>I could not even figure out<br>what to do with myself.<br><br>You guys fell in love<br>and you chose somebody to marry you<br><br>without ever seeing them.<br><br>Honestly, I think all of the guys<br>are really...<br><br>attractive dudes.<br><br>But I can\\'t possibly imagine having<br><br>this physical attraction to anybody else<br>like I do with Barnett.<br><br>So, we\\'ve kept your devices from you.<br><br>You\\'ve had no distractions,<br>nothing to get in the way.<br><br>Here, you have the chance to develop your<br>emotional connection into a physical one.<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>When you go back home, will the realities<br>of the material world, your looks,<br><br>your race, your age, your background,<br><br>affect the way you feel about each other?<br><br>How are you guys going to integrate<br>your lives?<br><br>Think about it. How are you going to<br>integrate your friends,<br><br>your families, your careers, your homes?<br><br>How is all of that going to come together<br>with your fiancé?<br><br>Your weddings are just four weeks away.<br><br>Will you say \"I do\" to the person<br>you chose to marry,<br><br>sight unseen,<br><br>or will you walk away from them forever?<br><br>Is love truly blind?<br><br>You better say \"I do.\"<br><br>To love and happiness<br><br>and to all of you<br><br>living in the moment. Cheers.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Have fun, you guys!<br>So happy for you.<br><br>Okay, let\\'s get this party started.<br><br>- That was a big shot.<br>- Did you slam it down?<br><br>It\\'s a pleasure meeting both of y\\'all.<br><br>We got chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.<br><br>And, and Kenny\\'s right in the middle.<br><br>- All for that.<br>- This is... This is perfect.<br><br>Gigi should model, for sure.<br><br>I wasn\\'t surprised in the least bit.<br><br>I mean, it\\'s just funny,<br>the lines you draw to the voices.<br><br>She\\'s gorgeous. She really is.<br><br>- What are you doing?<br>- This is so weird.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Like, I got...<br><br>Can you close your eyes without your hand?<br><br>I can\\'t associate the face with the voice<br>I\\'m hearing right now, it\\'s so new.<br><br>I think Amber is a beautiful woman,<br>but I don\\'t know how to explain it, but...<br><br>she is...<br><br>a lot.<br><br>For sure.<br><br>Whoo!<br><br>Mark is...<br><br>smaller than I thought he was.<br><br>Let\\'s go!<br><br>There\\'s more diction in your voice<br>when you\\'re in person.<br><br>- Oh, really.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Than in the pods.<br>- Yeah, the pods.<br><br>- Everyone was saying that.<br>- But you really were the most calm talker.<br><br>So calm.<br><br>I was like, \"Oh my God, I feel like<br>I need to get a massage right now.\"<br><br>Cameron has this, like,<br>just adorable smile and he\\'s pretty hot.<br><br>You know?<br><br>Whatever.<br><br>I\\'ve heard a lot about you, Barnett.<br><br>You heard a lot about me?<br><br>- Yes, I have.<br>- Hopefully all good things.<br><br>That\\'s not how that went, darling.<br><br>That is not how that went.<br><br>Now that I see Barnett in the flesh<br><br>after all of the drama,<br>all of the large wine glasses<br><br>that were consumed on the girls\\' side<br>due to this man,<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don\\'t know, I pictured that he would be<br>this kind of frat-looking guy, like a bro,<br><br>and I feel like that\\'s what he is, so...<br><br>I think I gauged him right.<br><br>But, you know, man, it\\'s just crazy<br>how we started and...<br><br>Where we\\'re at right now,<br>which is not even the end.<br><br>- That\\'s what the crazy part is.<br>- No.<br><br>It\\'s the beginning.<br><br>I was talking to Kelly today<br>about it.<br><br>I mean, it\\'s...<br><br>This is legitimate,<br>it\\'s not just something that\\'s,<br><br>\"We went through this process,<br><br>- it\\'s an experiment.\"<br>- Right.<br><br>- It was.<br>- It was.<br><br>But we got through that,<br>and now it\\'s all becoming real.<br><br>It\\'s becoming very real.<br><br>This is a serious conversation<br>that everybody wants to know.<br><br>And I\\'m asking this<br>for a very particular reason, not just...<br><br>to make anybody kiss and tell.<br><br>But sex is a big ordeal.<br><br>It\\'s something that is... to help<br>maintain a healthy relationship, right?<br><br>And I\\'ll start.<br><br>So, like, me and Giannina,<br>we\\'re like... She literally goes...<br><br>Last night we were at dinner having<br>this romantic dinner, and she goes,<br><br>\"What are your feelings on sex?\"<br><br>I said, \"You know what?<br>When you\\'re ready.\"<br><br>And they called for dessert.<br>I was like, \"Yes, I\\'m ready for dessert.\"<br><br>She goes, \"I\\'m good.\"<br><br>I was like, \"You don\\'t want dessert?\"<br>She goes, \"I am dessert.\"<br><br>- There you go.<br>- And I was like, \"Well.\"<br><br>Well.<br><br>But, but it was a whole thing of respect<br>and mutual agreement<br><br>and it was something beautiful<br>and it\\'s so much more than just sex.<br><br>Did everybody get down<br>and dirty last night?<br><br>Let\\'s just say I was at day 398<br>and now I\\'m at day...<br><br>- I\\'m happy for you.<br>- I\\'m with you, G.<br><br>I have that connection with Damian.<br><br>The emotional connection.<br><br>That\\'s the difference<br>between the sex being good,<br><br>and the sex being fucking fantastic.<br><br>And so we toast to good sex,<br>because that\\'s the cherry on top.<br><br>We didn\\'t go to sleep<br>till like 4:00 last night.<br><br>Oh yeah, yes! All right.<br><br>- We had a great time together.<br>- I love Cameron\\'s reaction.<br><br>We had a great time.<br><br>I cannot keep my hands off of this man,<br>you guys.<br><br>- No. Yeah, I\\'m working on that.<br>- So I take it your first night was...<br><br>- Good.<br>- Ooh, girl.<br><br>- Barnett, how was your night?<br>- Yeah!<br><br>We haven\\'t heard anything<br>from him, man.<br><br>- So, how was your first night...<br>- Oh, God.<br><br>So, I pulled my back out, pulling...<br><br>- Taking the luggage in.<br>- No, you did not.<br><br>Slept on the couch.<br><br>- No, you didn\\'t.<br>- Please tell us a realistic story.<br><br>- Will you tell us, Barnett?<br>- No.<br><br>If you pulled your back out,<br>it wasn\\'t from luggage.<br><br>I\\'m being patient,<br>but everyone else is having sex.<br><br>And it sucks.<br><br>Girl, I was gonna say last night,<br><br>- this morning, this afternoon,<br>- We were all over that room,<br><br>before we came out here...<br><br>This morning in the shower...<br><br>Hanging out with all the other girls,<br><br>I caught myself being a little worried<br><br>that I might not be<br>as excited as they were.<br><br>You know how I said before,<br>when he was still talking to LC.<br><br>I\\'m like... I want him to be happy,<br>I care about him so much.<br><br>If he wants to be with somebody else,<br>I\\'ll be happy for him.<br><br>Being with him now,<br>I\\'m like \"No, nobody else.<br><br>It\\'s you and me.<br>You have to be with me,<br><br>- we\\'re meant to be together.\"<br>- Yeah.<br><br>We fit so fucking well...<br><br>I can tell.<br><br>...it\\'s ridiculous.<br><br>Everyone just seemed head over heels.<br><br>- Are you gonna give Mark the poom-poom?<br>- What\\'s that?<br><br>Jessica is 30-something years old.<br><br>She knows damn well what a poom-poom is.<br>You\\'re not fooling me, Jessica.<br><br>The pussy, girl.<br><br>Okay, when... Okay, here\\'s my thing.<br><br>Coming out of the pod,<br>it\\'s two different things for me.<br><br>There\\'s like the person, the voice,<br>the persona,<br><br>and then there\\'s the physical person.<br><br>- I\\'m still trying to put that together.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>It\\'s no rush,<br>it\\'s only the second day.<br><br>- Are you sharing the bed?<br>- Oh, totally.<br><br>- Just cuddle, though.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>That\\'s where me and Kenny are, too.<br>We\\'ve made out, but that\\'s it.<br><br>I can say this.<br>Hey, I don\\'t kiss and tell.<br><br>I did not and could not go<br>for a run this morning.<br><br>That\\'s all I\\'m gonna say.<br><br>See, there it is.<br><br>I do declare, Kenny.<br><br>We kept it PG. We had good make-outs.<br><br>Me, on the other hand...<br><br>Everyone\\'s a great catch here.<br><br>So I think that...<br><br>everyone just found their match.<br><br>I love seeing them in love.<br>Seeing them happy makes me happy.<br><br>Whoo!<br><br>Oh, shit.<br><br>And I caught it.<br><br>Barnett\\'s definitely an attractive guy.<br><br>This is someone that I created a bond with<br>that I\\'ll never...<br><br>It will never be matched<br>by any other bond.<br><br>I mean, to have feelings for someone<br>so strongly that you want to<br><br>tell them you\\'ll marry them and within<br><br>twelve hours to retract it...<br><br>Is it true that...<br><br>you still feel the same way<br>you felt last night?<br><br>About me?<br><br>I mean, I don\\'t know.<br><br>- Wait, really?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You told me last night that you were<br>ready to, like, propose to me.<br><br>That\\'s insane.<br><br>You literally said that last night.<br><br>I don\\'t know what\\'s up, in my mind.<br><br>The moment he told me<br>he had changed his mind,<br><br>my body just absolutely gave out<br>and I saw my life flash before my eyes.<br><br>Finally being able to see him,<br>I\\'m going to try to keep my composure.<br><br>- Oh, God. Oh, God.<br>- Oh, God. Oh, man.<br><br>- How are you?<br>- What\\'s up?<br><br>- I\\'m great, how are you?<br>- Best buddy.<br><br>- Oh, yeah, we\\'re best friends now.<br>- Give me some love.<br><br>- How\\'s it going?<br>- It\\'s going good.<br><br>- You having a good time?<br>- So much fun.<br><br>I don\\'t know what the words<br>are exactly yet,<br><br>I don\\'t know what order<br>they\\'re going to be in,<br><br>but my last conversation with Jessica<br><br>never was meant to be something<br>that was supposed to be hurtful.<br><br>I want to talk to her, still.<br><br>I want another chance<br>to talk to her, for sure.<br><br>I\\'m sorry that I upset you that one night.<br><br>Well, it was a late night date<br>that was, like...<br><br>It was too much.<br><br>I never could figure out,<br><br>- \"How did we get there?\"<br>- I don\\'t even know.<br><br>I feel so awkward<br>in this moment.<br><br>We\\'re both here with our new fiancés<br>and I felt so strongly about him.<br><br>I really did.<br><br>- I didn\\'t know how to handle it.<br>- It\\'s okay.<br><br>I was trying to figure it out.<br><br>Like, I don\\'t know what to say.<br><br>There\\'s not a reason this doesn\\'t work.<br>There\\'s nothing I don\\'t like about you.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Nothing.<br><br>I know Jessica and Barnett built<br>an emotional connection in the pods,<br><br>and, you know, she ended up with me.<br><br>I\\'m not losing her again.<br><br>She\\'s with me now.<br><br>What\\'s up?<br><br>The odds of Jessica putting up any kind<br>of a fight with me are so low, it\\'s sad.<br><br>Not sad. Laughable.<br><br>I told him if he goes anywhere,<br>I\\'d hunt him down.<br><br>I love that.<br><br>I\\'d hunt him down.<br>He\\'s not going anywhere.<br><br>\\n    </div>\\n    <script async=\"\" src=\"./Love Is Blind_ Season 1, Episode 4 script _ Subs like Script_files/f.txt\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\\n<!-- content_before_content_square_adaptive -->\\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-9736463211397065\" data-ad-slot=\"9732296380\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\"><iframe id=\"aswift_3\" style=\"height: 1px !important; max-height: 1px !important; max-width: 1px !important; width: 1px !important;\" src=\"./Love Is Blind_ Season 1, Episode 4 script _ Subs like Script_files/saved_resource(6).html\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_frame3\" src=\"./Love Is Blind_ Season 1, Episode 4 script _ Subs like Script_files/saved_resource(7).html\"></iframe></iframe></ins>\\n<script>\\n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n</script>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</article>\\n<nav class=\"prevnext\">\\n\\t<span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://subslikescript.com/series/Love_Is_Blind-11704040/season-1/episode-3-First_Night_Together\" title=\"Previous Episode of Tv Series &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; - Season 1, episode 3 &quot;First Night Together&quot;\">Previous Episode</a>\\n\\t\\t</span>\\n\\n\\t\\t<span>\\n\\t\\t<a href=\"https://subslikescript.com/series/Love_Is_Blind-11704040/season-1/episode-5-Last_Night_in_Paradise\" title=\"Next Episode of Tv Series &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; - Season 1, episode 5 &quot;Last Night in Paradise&quot;\">Next Episode</a>\\n\\t\\t</span>\\n</nav>\\n\\t        </main>\\n\\t        <div class=\"left-side\"></div>\\n\\t        <div class=\"right-side\"></div>\\n    \\t</div>\\n    \\t<!--main-wrapper div ending-->\\n        <footer>\\n           <span class=\"contactus\">Have any questions?
