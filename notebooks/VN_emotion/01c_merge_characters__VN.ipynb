    "# VN Character Merging - Combine All 4 Characters into One\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Merge all 4 VN characters into a single unified character for better training with limited data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Current data: 90-128 examples per character (below 250-500 minimum for viable fine-tuning)\n",
    "- Merged data: ~439 examples total (closer to minimum viable)\n",
    "- Trade-off: Sacrifice character variety for better response quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does:**\n",
    "1. 📚 Load all 4 VN character JSONL files (Monika, Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri)\n",
    "2. ✨ **Enhanced cleaning** of VN formatting artifacts:\n",
    "   - Removes ALL Ren'Py tags: `{cps=60}`, `{nw}`, `{w}`, `{fast}`, `{space=...}`, etc.\n",
    "   - Replaces character name mentions with \"another member\" to prevent blending\n",
    "   - Removes basic formatting: `{i}`, `{b}`, `{color}`, etc.\n",
    "3. 🎭 Create unified general persona combining elements from all 4\n",
    "4. 🔄 Replace character-specific system prompts with unified persona\n",
    "5. ✅ **Validation** to verify all artifacts removed\n",
    "6. 💾 Save cleaned merged data to `vn_training_data_merged.jsonl`\n",
    "7. 📊 Generate statistics and comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements over previous version:**\n",
    "- ✅ Removes 38+ Ren'Py animation/timing tags previously missed\n",
    "- ✅ Eliminates 174 character name mentions that caused blending\n",
    "- ✅ Adds validation step to catch any remaining issues\n",
    "- ✅ Cleaner training data → better model quality\n",
